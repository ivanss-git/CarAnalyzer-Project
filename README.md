# About me 

Hello all! I have some previous experience in C++ and recently got into learning java just over a month ago. I also got into the car business this year and thought it
would be a great way for me to apply what i've learned.

# Car Analyzer

I intend to continue using this to help me purchase used cars on various auction sites hoping to flip them for a profit.
It calculates the market value, repair cost, and provides me with a suggestion on the max amount i should pay for the car if im looking to make x dollars in profit. 

# Future plans 

-Add more evaluation metrics
-Analyze real time data through web scraping for more accurate results
-Create a website to list my inventory of cars

# Feedback

I'm open to any and all feedback! 

# How to run

bash
./run.sh
